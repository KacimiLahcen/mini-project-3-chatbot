This is a simple chatbot program created in C by **Yassine Sekkah && Lahcen Kacimi** 

The chatbot interacts with the user by asking how they feel and responds with randomized
 answers depending on whether the user's input is positive, negative, or neutral.
  The program uses basic string matching to interpret the sentiment of the userâ€™s message.
